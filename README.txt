# cs123a-project
HMM-based Prokaryotic Gene Prediction

"Final_CS123A.py" uses three text files: "seq1.txt", "seq2.txt", and "seq3.txt."  These files are in the FASTA format taken from Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 complete genome with accession number NC_000913.3 from the NCBI database.  Make sure the three .txt files and the .py file are in the same directory before running the program.

After downloading the code follow these instructions to run the code:

1. Unzip the compressed files and open a Python IDE such as PyCharm
2. Create a new project in the IDE and import the Final_CS123A.py file
3. Make sure you have Python packages, numpy and panda, installed. If you donâ€™t, install those packages.
4. Now we need to make sure we have our input files. Import the input files seq1.txt, seq2.txt, and seq3.txt
5. With these input files and packages installed the code should compile with no issues.
6. Now, run the code in your IDE.
You may run this code on your own sequences. Just replace the txt files with the sequences you would like to use.
