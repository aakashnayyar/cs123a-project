# cs123a-project
HMM-based Prokaryotic Gene Prediction

"Final_CS123A.py" uses three text files: "seq1.txt", "seq2.txt", and "seq3.txt."  These files are in the FASTA format taken from Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 complete genome with accession number NC_000913.3 from the NCBI database.  Make sure the three .txt files and the .py file are in the same directory before running the program.
